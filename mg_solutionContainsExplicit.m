%=== Function Summary ===
%
%Function Name: mg_solutionContainsExplicit
%
%Description:
%   This function searches for keywords used in the solution. It is an
%   extension to the existing keyword search and allows for checking regular expressions.
%   Comments in the solution are filtered and ignored.
%
%Inputs:
%   statements (Sting array)
%       keywords (normal strings and regular expressions) that the function
%       shall look for. You can check for multiple keywords in order to catch
%       "look-a-likes"
%
%   varargin (strings)
%       Filenames or parts of filenames that shall be ignored while determing
%       the name of the solution file. Use this to preent your own uploaded
%       files from beeing scanned.
% 
%Outputs:
%   present (bool)
%       true: at least one statement was used in the solution
%       false: no statement was used in the solution

function present = mg_solutionContainsExplicit(statements, varargin)
    
    % Finding the solution file and reading its content.
    filename = getMGFileName(varargin);
    content = fileread(filename);
    
    %content as lines, remove empty lines
    as_lines = regexp(content, '\r?\n', 'split');
    as_lines = as_lines(~cellfun('isempty', as_lines));
    
    present = false();
    
    for statement = statements
        
        %compare expressions found with the ones found in comments
        expressionsFound = regexp(as_lines, statement);
        expressionsCFound = regexp(as_lines, "%.*"+statement);

        if length([expressionsFound{:}]) > length([expressionsCFound{:}])
            %at least one expression was found
            present = true();
            return
        end
    end
end
